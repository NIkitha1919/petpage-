<p class="des">We have used Portman on multiple occasions. It has been a great company to work with and I've always had a good experience. The pet sitter Paul did a great job caring for my elderly dogs and meeting their medical/special needs. He was also great about texting me daily to let me know how my dogs were doing.<br>

<p class="des">I have 2 german shepards and they are my children. Deborah has been my sitter for the last 4 years and she is amazing. When we come home I can see they are well taken care of. I think they don't really care if I come home as long as Deborah is caring for them.<br>
